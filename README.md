# Numericode Processor

## Getting Started

This is a numericode encoder and decoder coded using Next.js, React Typescript and Jest/React Testing.

The front end is a single page web app with a react component that contains a single input, with both the encode and decode buttons below, as well as the output paragraph.

It makes a call to the Next API, where the messages are either encoded or decoced accordingly.
